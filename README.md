# LA-Dodgers-SQL-Database
In the Los Angeles Dodgers project, I created a comprehensive SQL database to manage player details, game stats, individual batter and pitcher performance, and ticket sales data. I structured tables to store game statistics, assigned MVPs for regular and post-season games, and developed a view to filter batters with averages over .300, enabling focused analysis on top players. Through this project, I enhanced my SQL skills by practicing data insertion, date handling, and creating views, while gaining a deeper understanding of database design for sports analytics, specifically in big data environments.

After creating database I created queries to extract insights and create visualizations
